# ***Details:***

This tip calculator is my first solo project in the JTC program Fall/2021.
Written using Python 3 in Visual Code.
This code has been created based on all the concepts taught by JTC.
For example floats, integers, mathematical concepts and converting the correct decimal point format.
I am very excited to have created this Tip_Calculator!

# *** Here are the steps to successfully run the Tip_Calculator:***
Run the file in the terminal
You begin with the user input
___First Question #1___ "What is the total bill?"

___Second Question #2___ "What percent tip would you like to give?"

___Third Questions #3___ "How Many people will split the bill?"

Emma's Tip_Calculator will perform the calculations to provide each person a total amount due:
